# Seed-VC  
[![Hugging Face](https://img.shields.io/badge/ü§ó%20Hugging%20Face-Demo-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Plachta/Seed-VC)  

*English | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README-CN.md)*  
Currently released model supports *zero-shot voice conversion* üîä and *zero-shot singing voice conversion* üéô. Without any training, it is able to clone a voice given a reference speech of 1~30 seconds.  

To find a list of demos and comparisons with previous voice conversion models, please visit our [demo page](https://plachtaa.github.io/seed-vc/)üåê  

We are keeping on improving the model quality and adding more features.

## Evaluationüìä
We have performed a series of objective evaluations on our Seed-VC's voice conversion capabilities. 
For ease of reproduction, source audios are 100 random utterances from LibriTTS-test-clean, and reference audios are 12 randomly picked in-the-wild voices with unique characteristics. <br>  

Source audios can be found under `./examples/libritts-test-clean` <br>
Reference audios can be found under `./examples/reference` <br>

We evaluate the conversion results in terms of speaker embedding cosine similarity (SECS), word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER) and compared
our results with two strong open sourced baselines, namely [OpenVoice](https://github.com/myshell-ai/OpenVoice) and [CosyVoice](https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/CosyVoice).  
Results in the table below shows that our Seed-VC model significantly outperforms the baseline models in both intelligibility and speaker similarity.<br>

| Models\Metrics | SECS‚Üë      | WER‚Üì      | CER‚Üì     | SIG‚Üë     | BAK‚Üë     | OVRL‚Üë    |
|----------------|------------|-----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|

| OpenVoice      | 0.7547     | 15.46     | 4.73     | **3.56** | **4.02** | **3.27** |
| CosyVoice      | 0.8440     | 18.98     | 7.29     | 3.51     | **4.02** | 3.21     |
| Seed-VC(Ours)  | **0.8676** | **11.99** | **2.92** | 3.42     | 3.97     | 3.11     |

We have also compared with non-zero-shot voice conversion models for several speakers (based on model availability):

| ~           | Ground Truth   | 1.0000     | 6.43      | 1.00     | ~        | ~        | ~        |
| Tokai Teio  | So-VITS-4.0    | 0.8637     | 21.46     | 9.63     | 3.06     | 3.66     | 2.68     |
|             | Seed-VC(Ours)  | **0.8899** | **15.32** | **4.66** | **3.12** | **3.71** | **2.72** |
| Milky Green | So-VITS-4.0    | 0.6850     | 48.43     | 32.50    | 3.34     | 3.51     | 2.82     |
|             | Seed-VC(Ours)  | **0.8072** | **7.26**  | **1.32** | **3.48** | **4.07** | **3.20** |

Results show that, despite not being trained on the target speakers, Seed-VC is able to achieve significantly better results than the non-zero-shot models. 
However, this may vary a low depending on the SoVITS model quality. PR or Issue is welcomed if you find this comparison unfair or inaccurate.

You can reproduce the evaluation by running `eval.py` script.  
```bash
python eval.py 
--source ./examples/libritts-test-clean
--target ./examples/reference
--output ./examples/eval/converted
--diffusion-steps 25
--length-adjust 1.0
--inference-cfg-rate 0.7
--xvector-extractor "resemblyzer"
--baseline ""  # fill in openvoice or cosyvoice to compute baseline result
--max-samples 100  # max source utterances to go through
```
Before that, make sure you have openvoice and cosyvoice repo correctly installed on `../OpenVoice/` and `../CosyVoice/` if you would like to run baseline evaluation.

## Installationüì•
Suggested python 3.10 on Windows or Linux.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usageüõ†Ô∏è
Checkpoints of the latest model release will be downloaded automatically when first run inference.  

Command line inference:
```bash
python inference.py --source <source-wav>
--target <referene-wav>
--output <output-dir>
--diffusion-steps 25 # recommended 50~100 for singingvoice conversion
--length-adjust 1.0
--inference-cfg-rate 0.7
--f0-condition False # set to True for singing voice conversion
--auto-f0-adjust False # set to True to auto adjust source pitch to target pitch level, normally not used in singing voice conversion
--semi-tone-shift 0 # pitch shift in semitones for singing voice conversion
```
where:
- `source` is the path to the speech file to convert to reference voice
- `target` is the path to the speech file as voice reference
- `output` is the path to the output directory
- `diffusion-steps` is the number of diffusion steps to use, default is 25, use 50-100 for best quality, use 4-10 for fastest inference
- `length-adjust` is the length adjustment factor, default is 1.0, set <1.0 for speed-up speech, >1.0 for slow-down speech
- `inference-cfg-rate` has subtle difference in the output, default is 0.7 
- `f0-condition` is the flag to condition the pitch of the output to the pitch of the source audio, default is False, set to True for singing voice conversion  
- `auto-f0-adjust` is the flag to auto adjust source pitch to target pitch level, default is False, normally not used in singing voice conversion
- `semi-tone-shift` is the pitch shift in semitones for singing voice conversion, default is 0
